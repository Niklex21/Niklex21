# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex Nikanov

- I am studying Computer Science and Business at Northeastern University, focusing on the intersection of AI & social innovations.

- I have 4+ years of experience building web applications for companies such as BurnCam (medical tech) and @DipJar (non-profit tech), and I am an award-winning startup founder (with 5+ awards at a variety of international competitions). 

- I am currently using my skills at https://shop4ua.com/ -- a startup I co-founded to raise awareness for Ukraine-supporting businesses -- and another creator-space stealth startup (more to come soon).

- My personal interests include mountain biking, cooking, and travel photography. Hit me up if you want to talk about social entrepreneurship, startups, edtech, or cool software.
- Hit me up at https://linkedin.com/alex-nikanov, or mailto:alekseynikanov.21@gmail.com.

Cheers ðŸ˜Š
