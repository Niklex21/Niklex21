# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex Nikanov

# About me
I am studying Computer Science and Business at Northeastern University, focusing on the intersection of AI & social innovations.

I have 4+ years of experience building web applications for companies such as BurnCam (medical tech) and @DipJar (non-profit tech), and I am an award-winning startup founder (with 5+ awards at a variety of international competitions). 

I am currently using my skills at https://shop4ua.com/ -- a startup I co-founded to raise awareness for Ukraine-supporting businesses -- and another creator-space stealth startup (more to come soon).

My personal interests include mountain biking, cooking, and traveling. Hit me up if you want to talk about social entrepreneurship, startups, edtech, or cool software.

Cheers ðŸ˜Š
